                <p>    My name is Arkeldi and welcome to my personal webpage. Within my websites, you'll learn a little bit about me and my journey as a computer engineering student at Texas A&M University. I am currently a third year student and continue to make the most of my time by enhancing my education and growing as a learner. Thank you for taking the time to visit my page and I hope you enjoy learning more about me.
                </p>
                <h2 id="first" class="first">Where I'm From</h2>
                <p>
                    I have a seemingly genetic relation to engineering, as both my mother, a mathematics professor at Austin Community College, and my father, an engineering graduate from the University of Albania, have influenced my passion for the field. I was first introduced to the field of computer engineering through job shadowing my uncle at Aetna's headquarters. It was this experience that gave me a sneak peak 
                    into what I can achieve if I push for future in engineering. Later on in 2017, my family and I moved 
                    to the flourishing city of Austin, Texas where I started to build a strong academic career at Westwood High School to ensure my success as a computer engineering student at 
                    Texas A&M. 
                </p>
                <h2 id="first" class="first">Where I Want to Go</h2>
                <p>
                    Classes like computer architecture and design, computer systems, data structures and algorithms, discrete structures for computing, computer systems, electrical circuit theory, and topics in applied mathematics are all examples of courses that have pushed to 
                    become a sharper, more technical student for when it comes to professional applications. I constantly seek opportunities to apply these skills outside of the classroom, such as my research internship where I developed a Python program to test nickel-based superalloys. I am also a member of the Electrical Power Subsystem team for AggieSat 7, a student-led satellite project under the guidance of Dr. Helen L. Reed.
                    As I find more meaningful organizations and experiences at Texas A&M, I consistently refelect and evaluate my long term goal of what to work as after college. I plan to graduate by 2024 and hopefully join the tech workforce somewhere in Austin. College Station to me is a home away from home, but Austin is where my heart truly resides.
