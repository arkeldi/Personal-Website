# <p align="center">Arkeldi's Personal Website<p>

Hello! 
This repository contains the code I wrote for my very own personal website. Within it, you learn a little bit more about me and my life as a computer engineering student. 
This is my first stab at programming on the front-end side of things and allowed me to understand graphic/web design.
